                    <p>I have always enjoyed all types of sports, but soccer was my favourite. I started playing 
			that game since I was very young. It all started when my neighbor and I bought our first ball 
			and started playing on the street next to the building we lived in. Then I decided to take the
			next step by joining an academy. At that time, I was already in a basketball academy, but I 
			have decided to quit since it was clear to me that I enjoy soccer a lot more. From that moment 
			it became my obsession. The only places to find me if I am not at practice nor school, would 
			be on the street playing more soccer, or in my bedroom watching soccer videos.</p>
			<p> Soon I started improving a lot and at that time, I was seen as the team's leader especially when we started 
			competing in tournaments. As the years went by, I kept improving until I became the team's 
			captain and I got drafted to the National Soccer Team, at the age of 14. Unfortunately, about 
			a year and half later I decided to give up on my dream of becoming a professional player and 
			focus on my education. I stepped back a little bit and gave it less time but I kept playing 
			frequently: at least 5 hours a week.</p>
			<p>When I got into college, I started practicing again with my old team, but I knew that it was going to be no more than a hobby of mine. A year later, I 
			transferred to William Paterson University and joined there men's soccer team for one year before
			transeferring again to NJIT.</p>
